title: Take care of yourself
---

***This is my first post writed in english language, please be nice with me and forgive my mistakes. After this disclaimer I will start the article subject.***

I came from a terrible moment in my programmer life (and my personal life too). I dropped 2 jobs cause mental issues combined with personal issues, I was in a condition with no energy and too much anxiety. This situation made me stopped jobs after colapses.

Now I know the importance to keep balance beetwen mental health and programming practice. I love oriented object programming and concepts like dependency injection and interfaces. I study this subjects since 2014, but my study time was exagerated (without selfcare) and this cost a expensive price for me.

Mind need care and this is a real thing, so remember this. Mind need maintance like source-code. Take care of you mind and your mental health, take care of yourself and don't let things get ugly before apply this on your life. Negligence is a expensive price  to pay, cause this cost pain and life.
